One of the first thoughts through my head today: Friends, so many of them immigrants, asylees, refugees, feeling unsafe, unwelcome, uncertain in their new homes the last 4 yrs, will FINALLY feel home. To me, that is reason enough to celebrate this remarkable day.  


Why am I feeling so unnerved? A decent Presidential ticket has won, yet I feel like very bad things are about to happen.  


The feeling of relief is unbelievable!!!! I cannot believe how good it feels. Thank you Detroit, thank you Philly, thank you Georgia. Thank you to everyone who voted, everyone who volunteered. YOU matter. Your VOTE matters!! #bidenharris2020


the feeling that trump supporters are feeling rn is exactly the same feeling that the entire world felt 4 years ago. how does it feel?  


But man it feels good to have this orange cloud disappear especially with the week of gaming ahead and Seahawks playing the Bills tomorrow I can enjoy these things without the feeling that I'm "escaping"  


It’s insanely relieving and a really nice feeling to no longer feel like the world’s punchline. #YoureFiredTrump #YOUREFIRED #PresidentElectJoeBiden  


I don’t feel like celebrating this victory. It’s bittersweet. I’m feeling sadness for what we’ve been put through and continue to go through. I just feel relieved... #recovering #bittersweet @GOP @DNC


This brought me to tears. I have missed feeling like a part of the world. Church bells ringing, people singing and dancing in the streets here and across the world. It feels better than I could have ever imagined. #PresidentElectBiden #VicePresidentElectHarris  


"Why Biden Can Overcome Political Gridlock." So you're telling me there's a chance... #Biden  


Today’s spontaneous celebrations across our cities will always bring a smile to my face when I look back on this day. I will remember feeling hope once again and that I finally sleep well tonight. Feels like an elephant got off my chest and I can finally breathe. #


My heart feels so full and happy!!! I feel like there’s hope. I feel like things are going to be okay. Biden wasn’t my first choice for this election but I haven’t seen compassion from a president in years. What a feeling. I’m over the moon!  #BidenHarris2020


I literally have chills on top of my chills, the feeling when a certain song makes you warm with goosebumps that feel euphoric, that's how I'm feeling knowing @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris are the next PRESIDENT & FIRST EVER WOMAN AS WELL AS WOMAN OF COLOR VICE PRESIDENT 


Love has really won today. And it feels so incredible. I had forgotten this feeling when a leader is on your side, not politically, but morally.  


I'm sitting in q parking lot bawling like a baby. I slept in because u couldn't handle the stress and feeling like this would never come. I don't even know why I'm crying. But damn it feels amazing.  


Four years ago, when Trump became President-Elect, I walked around Dublin feeling like a zombie as I was in a state of shock. Today, with President-Elect Biden, I feel a wave of relief for entire world. I can breathe deep and feel calm. Congratulations.  


One of the best things about how I feel right now is knowing how many people are feeling it with me. The people dancing in the streets is everything. The celebrations around the world are giving me chills. Thank you all! We did it! #JoeBiden #Resistance


To all #Indians feeling joy and pride in @KamalaHarris being the first half Indian woman making history as Vice President do not to erase #Jamaica. It feels better to own and associate with success still she is #Jamaican #Indian America, not half Indian. #JoeBiden  


I have a feeling this ain’t over, not a bit. Full shit storm mode (from both sides) until at least December 4. Then the shit will really hit the fan. Got them 2000 vibe feels, but polarized. #ShouldhavevotedKanye


As a woman. As an Indigenous minority. As a member of the gay community. I wake up today feeling a sense of relief. I wake up feeling like I am no longer holding my breath. I feel inspired. I feel free. #BidenHarris2020   #Indigenous #LGBTQ


Most of America planned for riots. Little did we know we’d be having spontaneous dance parties at gas stations or in the middle of the street. What a proud moment for America.  


Kamala Harris walks out in suffragette white. It took EXACTLY 100 years after we earned the right to vote to achieve the Vice Presidency. Let us never stop perfecting our Union.


If this election has no fraud, why are the Democrats & media demanding there be no audit, no signature match check, no monitored hand recount, no production of the digitized ballots, no check on whether more votes than voters took place in some areas, and on and on?  


Once the Democratic Machine dissects   the pollsters will be blamed and fired for not being accurate in their secretive inner Beltway poll and causing the Dominion machine to come under high suspicion. Trump wins again.


Biden's team is more willing to call progressives terrorists than they are willing to call Trump's attempts to overturn the election a coup.


If you love this country and give a damn about democracy, the will of the people, and personal integrity, continue stepping up and speaking out #CoupAttempt  


Georgia remains blue after the recount. Will you Trump concede now?! #BlueWave #Recount #GEORIGA #ConcedeNowTrump


@realDonaldTrump is attempting to litigate the election into a second term in office. But you can’t win the presidency on technicalities and legal maneuvering. This charade is ridiculous and pathetic for Trump, and caustic for the country.  


“It felt really, really powerful,” Apshara Siwakoti said of voting after becoming a citizen. “I felt like I belong here. I felt like I actually have a home when I cast my ballot, so it was really powerful for me.” #copolitics  


That must really sting to lose Georgia. Twice. #GEORGIA  


Please tell me when we were Americans first this past 4 yrs while @Democrats spent the entire time trying to impeach the President, hold up anything & everything. But now that you won it’s sunshine & rainbows! #patheticpoliticians  


Giuliani says the Trump team has identified enough provable, illegal ballots to overturn the election.    results


God bless Neal Katyal and Barack Obama. Between watching Obama’s interview and Neal’s Courtside Instagram about why Trump won’t be successful in stealing the election, I might be able to sleep tonight. #anxiety


So far, no Nevada judge has yet found patterns of fraud in the nearly six Republican lawsuits filed.  


“This is a major moment, you guys are the literal vanguard” Alex Jones rallying the crowd of Trump supporters gathered inside the Georgia State Capitol #Atlanta #Georgia  


TRUMP LOST! LIVE WITH IT!


I think I'm only going to stay on Twitter so I can watch Joe Biden be a fuck head and embarrass himself over and over again. #PresidentTrump #Trump #JoeBiden   #coronavirus #COVID19


Trump could be spending $3 million helping Americans who have lost jobs and are food insecure. Instead he’s spending it on a hopeless attempt to keep power for himself. What a cow of Bashan (Amos 4:1). #DumpTrump2020 #TransitionNow @realDonaldTrump #Christian


Read the sworn affidavits of misconduct and irregularities filed in court. Even if the election results don’t change America is profoundly changed.  


#Trump & Pence are NOT reckless! They're trying to clean up the mess the #democrats made by insisting on using the fallible #mailinballots so they could easily CHEAT during  . President Trump is not attacking anyone. He has been attacked for years by evil, #liberal


This guy can do it!!! Fighting for #climate change, gun reform, legal marijuana, racial equality, justice reform, the voting rights act, and so much more! Standing with you #VotersDecided #blm #lgbt


Just remember @HillaryClinton conceded not sit here and cry like a little bitch.   #Biden2020 #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020


Given is on his way out after losing  , is this all a set up so he & Republicans can claim he got #drugpricing done, then blame Democrats when Biden's #HHS secretary doesn't sign off on it for precisely the reason it would increase #Medicare spending?


Too much of everything is always bad. We need characteristics of both sides to survive. For the well-being of #ThePeople, both party’s should want to maintain a perfect balance of power.  


The Arizona and Pennsylvania lawsuits goes something akin to: award the states’ electoral votes to me, a crime boss named @realDonaldTrump, because I believe i’m king Smirking face. Pack your bags #OneTermDonnie #YouAREFIRED #MAGA


I don't care if Donald Trump ever accepts that he lost  . As a matter of fact, I hope he never does. He can die mad about it for all I care. Ten years from now, tourists could be snapping pictures of a disheveled, orange tinted, mad man, dressed in a raggedy,


Looks like @JoeBiden is still winning #Georgia...again.   #BidenHarris2020


So @marcorubio and @SenRickScott are you going to put out a similar statement or remain #cowards #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #ProtectTheVote


The left promotes science for their agenda but refuses the preciseness of mathematics and refuses the obvious mathematical improbabilities being seen in the presidential election. It’s all in the numbers!! #MAGA


80,000,000 people voted for @JoeBiden. Let's talk about them & stop psychoanalyzing the racists. #latinovote  


Crazy Rudy supporting Trump's strategy to suppress the counting of the Black vote as a means to destroy democracy and steal the election. #CrazyRudy #Protect2020 #ProtectDemocracy
